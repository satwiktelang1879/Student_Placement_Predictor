# 🚀 Student Placement Predictor (Flask + Docker + Machine Learning)

An end-to-end Machine Learning web application that predicts whether a student is likely to get placed based on academic and skill-based performance metrics. The application is powered by a trained Random Forest Classifier, containerized using Docker, and deployed on Render.
